# üöÄ WebLane
Create fullstack websites with a simple prompt.

## üìå Problem Statement
Problem Statement - Weave AI Magic with Groq

## üéØ Objective
WebLane solves the challenge of web development accessibility by allowing anyone to create beautiful, functional websites using just natural language prompts. It serves both non-technical users who need websites but lack coding skills, and developers looking to quickly prototype ideas.

Our platform transforms text descriptions into fully-functional, production-ready websites using the power of AI, democratizing web development and drastically reducing the time from concept to deployment.
